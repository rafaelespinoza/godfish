    # SQLite3 doesn't actually have a client-server model. Instead, it's linked
    # to the application. The other databases in this project build test
    # environments of separate docker-compose services for the database and the
    # test client because setting up databases in general can be like wrestling
    # a bear. Unlike the other databases, the test environment for the sqlite3
    # driver can be built with just one docker-compose service.
    #
    # Q:  If there's no client-server, then why is this called "client"?
    # A:  Some CI-related tooling assumes that tests are taking place in a
    #     service called client, so it's just easier to set it up like this.
