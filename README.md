# godfish

`godfish` is a relational database migration manager. It's similar to the very
good [`dogfish`](https://github.com/dwb/dogfish), but written in golang.

Here are some notable differences between `dogfish` and `godfish`:

Filenames:

- dogfish: `migrate-${date}-${name}.sql`, or `rollback-${date}-${name}.sql`
- godfish: `forward-${date}-${name}.sql`, or `reverse-${date}-${name}.sql`

Note, dogfish uses the words, "migrate" and "rollback" to describe the
migration's direction whereas godfish uses "forward" and "reverse". They are
the same in that they are two complementaries. This change has one trivial
benefit, the pieces of metadata encoded into the filename naturally align:

```
cd /path/to/db/migrations && ls -1

forward-20191112050547-init_foos.sql
forward-20191127051242-add_bars.sql
forward-20191205031405-update_more_stuff.sql
reverse-20191112050547-init_foos.sql
reverse-20191127051242-add_bars.sql
reverse-20191205031405-update_more_stuff.sql
```
